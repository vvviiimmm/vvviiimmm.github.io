If you relatively new to functional programming but already at least somewhat familiar with higher order abstractions like `Functors`, `Applicatives` and `Monads`, you may find interesting to learn about [Yoneda lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoneda_lemma). This is not something you will use in your day to day work, it’s just a relatively easy exercise that can help you better understand more complex abstractions, like `Free` structures. If you want to get into deep categorical explanation on this topic I highly recommend Bartosz Milewski’s [“Understanding Yoneda”](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2013/05/15/understanding-yoneda/). In this article we will do something different — starting from practical use cases we will try to understand what is `(Co)Yoneda`, how it can be useful and how it can be implemented in scala.

## Yoneda
Let’s start with a simple example. You have a `List[Int]` and you want to make some transformations on it:

```scala
def f(a: Int): String = ???
def g(a: String): Option[Int] = ???
def h(a: Option[Int]): List[String] = ???

(0 to 10000000).map(f).map(g).map(h)
```

The list will be traversed 10000000 times, one per each `map`, which is not really efficient. List is a `Functor`, so it must obey the
`fmap (g . f) = fmap g . fmap f` law, which means that we can rewrite the expression with a single map passing a function composition of all transformations. Also, scala has `Streams` to lazily apply transformations on a sequence of values. But what if we had arbitrary Functor and not just `List`? Can we make an abstraction that can do that for us? Let’s call it `LazyFunctor` and think about an example of how we would use it:

```scala
val lazyOption: LazyFunctor[Option, Int] = toLazyFunctor(Some(42))
val transformed: LazyFunctor[Option, Int] = lazyOption.map(_ + 1).map(_ + 2) // silly example
// nothing is executed yet

// apply all transformations at once, yields Some(45)
val option: Option[Int] = fromLazyFunctor(transformed) 
```

The idea here is instead of actual function application our `LazyFunctor` will compose everything we pass to `map` and then execute all at once when we call `fromLazyFunctor`.

Let’s start with type class definition:

```scala
sealed trait LazyFunctor[F[_], A] {
  // takes a function and applies it to original value
  def transformation[B](f: A => B): F[B]

  // interace 'map' to be used as functor
  def map[B](f: A => B): LazyFunctor[F, B] = ???  
}
```

We have a trait taking two type parameters: `F[_]` is our type constructor and `A` is our value type. You can think about `transformation` as an “original map” of `F`, this is where we will “store” our composed functions. We also have `map` that should do the following:

1. Create an instance of new `LazyFunctor`
2. Redefine transformation of a new `LazyFunctor` to be a composition of provided function `f`

```scala
// lets also make it an abstrac class and add self type annotation
abstract class LazyFunctor[F[_], A] { self =>
  // function to be applied when we call "run"
  def transformation[B](f: A => B): F[B]

  // interace 'map' to be used as functor
  def map[B](f: A => B): LazyFunctor[F, B] = new LazyFunctor[F, B] {
    def transformation[C](g: B => C): F[C] = self.transformation(g compose f)
  } 
}
```

Here’s the clever trick — at the moment of calling `map` we know only the first function but we managed to create a composition with the function that will be passed to `map` **in the future**. This means that when we finish doing maps and we want to get our value back we need to actually call our `transformation`. It takes a function as an argument (remember, its almost like an `F`'s `map`), which will be the latest composed function in the chain. The obvious thing to do is to pass `identity` function. Lets add another function to do just that and call it `run`:

```scala
abstract class LazyFunctor[F[_], A] { self =>
  // should be implemented as a composition of transformations
  def transformation[B](f: A => B): F[B]
  
  // apply transformations and get our value back
  def run: F[A] = transformation(identity)
  
  // interace 'map' to be used as functor
  def map[B](f: A => B): LazyFunctor[F, B] = new LazyFunctor[F, B] {
    def transformation[C](g: B => C): F[C] = self.transformation(g compose f)
  } 
}
```

Now what’s left is to implement isomorphisms between `F[A]` and `LazyFunctor[F, A]` to be able to actually construct `LazyFunctor` and get the value back:

```scala
def toLazyFunctor[F[_], A](fa: F[A]): LazyFunctor[F, A] = ???

def fromLazyFunctor[F[_], A](lf: LazyFunctor[F, A]): F[A] = lf.run
```

Turns out we already have an implementation for `fromLazyFunctor` and that exactly `run` function.

Now, as for `toLazyFunctor`, we know that we need to create new instance of `LazyFunctor` and define `transformation` function for it. The thing is, `transformation` have to return `F[B]` and we don’t have a way of constructing this type. We can enforce `F[_]` to be a functor because we know that want to deal with functors. By doing that we could `map` over provided value `fa` with `transformation` function `f` (that again, will be provided later):

```scala
//                                   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
def toLazyFunctor[F[_], A](fa: F[A])(implicit F: Functor[F]): LazyFunctor[F, A] = 
  new LazyFunctor[F, A] {
    override def transformation[B](f: (A) => B): F[B] = F.map(fa)(f)
  }

def fromLazyFunctor[F[_], A](lf: LazyFunctor[F, A]): F[A] = lf.run
```

That’s about it, just one more detail — our `LazyFunctor` as actually known as `Yoneda`, so lets do some renames and see how the whole program looks like:

```scala
import cats.Functor

abstract class Yoneda[F[_], A] { self =>
  def transformation[B](f: A => B): F[B]

  def run: F[A] = transformation(identity)

  def map[B](f: A => B): Yoneda[F, B] = new Yoneda[F, B] {
    def transformation[C](g: (B) => C): F[C] = self.transformation(g compose f)
  }
}

def toYoneda[F[_], A](fa: F[A])(implicit F: Functor[F]): Yoneda[F, A] =
  new Yoneda[F, A] {
    override def transformation[B](f: (A) => B): F[B] = F.map(fa)(f)
  }

def fromYoneda[F[_], A](lf: Yoneda[F, A]): F[A] = lf.run

// usage example:
import cats.implicits._
val lazyOption: Yoneda[Option, Int] = toYoneda(Option(42))
val transformedOption: Yoneda[Option, Int] = lazyOption.map(_ + 1).map(_ + 2).map(_ + 3) // silly example
// nothing is executed until next line
val option: Option[Int] = lazyOption.run // apply all transformations at once
```

This is important: in order to start working with `Yoneda[F, A]` we have to provide functor instance for `F`.

## Coyoneda

Is it possible to do the same but without restrictions on `F` to be a `Functor`? Well, not really — we have original value in the context `F[A]`, we can compose all given functions `A => B` but we still need to know how to apply all those functions over `F[A]`. Can we defer restrictions on `F` to be a `Functor`? Maybe it might be useful to _pretend_ that `F` is a `Functor`, let user do maps and require a functor instance only at the point of getting the value back. Let’s think about usage example:

```scala
// our plain data structure
case class Person[A](a: A)

// lift Person value into theoretical 'PretendFunctor'
val personF: PretendFunctor[Person, Int] = toPretendFunctor(Person(42))
// Person is not a functor, but we can do maps
val personF2: PretendFunctor[Person, Int] = personF.map(_ + 1).map(_ + 2) // silly example
// nothing is executed yet

// we're done with transformations, now we need Person to be a Functor
val personFunctor = new Functor[Person] {
  override def map[A, B](fa: Person[A])(f: (A) => B): Person[B] = ???
}

// apply all transformations and get the value back
val person: Person[Int] = personF2.run(personFunctor) 
```

The use case is similar to `LazyFunctor` example, so we might think that `PretendFunctor`'s implementation is very similar. Lets first think about differences in the way we construct the values and getting the result back and then address the interface.

We know that `Yoneda` (our `LazyFunctor`) requires a Functor when we construct a value:

```scala
def toYoneda[F[_], A](fa: F[A])(implicit F: Functor[F]): Yoneda[F, A] = 
  new Yoneda[F, A] {
                                                     // vvvvvvvvvvvv
    override def transformation[B](f: (A) => B): F[B] = F.map(fa)(f)
  }
```

We don’t want to do that in our case, we want to defer that for later. In `Yoneda` we started the chain of function compositions by doing `F.map` and ended with `identity`. In `PretendFunctor` we will do the other way around — start from `identity` and end with `F.map`. It means that to construct `PretendFunctor` we need to provide two arguments — value in the context and a `transformation` function:

```scala
def toPretendFunctor[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B) : PretendFunctor[F, B] =
  new PretendFunctor[F, B] {
    ???
  }
```

Now lets think about actual `PretendFunctor` implementation. There are at least two functions we need to have — `map` and `run`:

```scala
sealed trait PretendFunctor[F[_], A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): PretendFunctor[F, B] = ???
  def run(f: Functor[F]) = ???
}
```

Lets start with `run`, should be straightforward:

```scala
sealed trait PretendFunctor[F[_], A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): PretendFunctor[F, B] = ???
  //             missing these   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv  vvvvvvvvvvvvv
  def run(f: Functor[F]) = f.map(underlyingValue)(transformation)
}
```

Ok, in order to call `f.map` we need to have both the value and the function which are passed to our `toPretendFunctor` function, so lets try to just save those arguments into trait’s fields:

```scala
sealed trait PretendFunctor[F[_], A] {
  //                   vvv hmm, F[A]? It should be F[something] and then yield A
  val underlyingValue: F[A]
  //                       v hmm, won't compile, don't have B
  val transformation: A => B

  def run(f: Functor[F]) = f.map(underlyingValue)(transformation)

  def map[B](f: A => B): PretendFunctor[F, B] = ???
}

def toPretendFunctor[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B) : PretendFunctor[F, B] =
  new PretendFunctor[F, B] {
    //                    vv hmm, no, 'fa' is of type F[A] but it has to be F[B]
    val underlyingValue = fa
    val transformation = f
  }
```

Problem is that `toPretendFunctor` should return `PretendFunctor[F, B]` and we can’t just override with `fa` and `f` simple because of types mismatch. It looks like we need to store the underlying _type_ of the value in context:

```scala
sealed trait PretendFunctor[F[_], A] {
  // should be specified
  type UnderlyingType

  val underlyingValue: F[UnderlyingType]

  // from underlying type to 'A'
  val transformation: UnderlyingType => A

  def run(f: Functor[F]) = f.map(underlyingValue)(transformation)

  def map[B](f: A => B): PretendFunctor[F, B] = ???
}

def toPretendFunctor[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B) : PretendFunctor[F, B]  =
  new PretendFunctor[F, B] {
    // save original type
    type UnderlyingType = A
    val transformation = f
    val underlyingValue = fa
  }
```

Great, that should compile, the hard part is over. The only thing left is our `map` function. It should create new `PretendFunctor` having `underlyingValue` and composition of `transformation` and given function f. We actually have it already implemented by `toPretendFunctor`:

```scala
sealed trait PretendFunctor[F[_], A] {
  type UnderlyingType

  val underlyingValue: F[UnderlyingType]

  val transformation: UnderlyingType => A

  def run(f: Functor[F]) = f.map(underlyingValue)(transformation)

  def map[B](f: A => B): PretendFunctor[F, B] = 
    toPretendFunctor(underlyingValue)(transformation andThen f)
}
```

Nice! Everything compiles and should do the trick. As you may guessed, `PretendFunctor` is known as `Coyoneda` which is a dual counterpart to `Yoneda`. Lets go back to our original example, do some renames and see how the whole program looks like:

```scala
sealed trait Coyoneda[F[_], A] {
  type UnderlyingType

  val underlyingValue: F[UnderlyingType]

  val transformation: UnderlyingType => A

  def run(f: Functor[F]) = f.map(underlyingValue)(transformation)

  def map[B](f: A => B): Coyoneda[F, B] =
    toCoyoneda(underlyingValue)(transformation andThen f)
}

def toCoyoneda[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B) : Coyoneda[F, B]  =
  new Coyoneda[F, B] {
    type UnderlyingType = A
    val transformation = f
    val underlyingValue = fa
}

// our simple data structure
case class Person[A](a: A)

val personCoyo0: Coyoneda[Person, Int] = toCoyoneda(Person(42))(identity)
val personCoyo1: Coyoneda[Person, Int] = personCoyo0.map(_ + 1).map(_ + 2).map(_ + 3) // silly example
// nothing is executed until next line

// lets define functor for Person
val personFunctor = new Functor[Person] {
  override def map[A, B](fa: Person[A])(f: (A) => B): Person[B] = Person(f(fa.a))
}

// and then pass it to Coyoneda
val person: Person[Int] = personCoyo1.run(personFunctor) // should yield Person(48)
```

We can go further and put `toCoyoneda` into `Coyoneda` companion object and rename it to `lift`, but you get the idea.

---

That’s it! We started from `LazyFunctor` (`Yoneda`) to fuse multiple `maps` into one, then we tried to overcome the restrictions on our data type to be a Functor by creating `PretendFunctor` (`Coyoneda`). Turns out, pretending to have a functor for any `F` is a really useful abstraction. You can “make” your plain data structure an `Applicative` or a `Monad` even if it’s not even a `Functor`. This trick is used in `Free` structures implementation, which is a very useful concept that can change the way we construct and compose and our programs. I hope this post was not too complicated because the ideas are not that complicated, its just the scala syntax that can bring some of the confusion. In contrast I want to end this article with code snippet of everything we have done so far implemented in Haskell — look how its easier to express our intentions and fit under 25 lines:

```haskell
-- Yoneda --------------------------------------------------------------
newtype Yoneda f a = Yoneda { runYoneda :: forall b. ((a -> b) -> f b) } 

instance Functor (Yoneda f) where
  fmap f y = Yoneda (\ab -> runYoneda y (ab . f))
  
toYoneda :: Functor f => f a -> Yoneda f a
toYoneda fa = Yoneda (\f -> fmap f fa)

fromYoneda :: Yoneda f a -> f a
fromYoneda y = runYoneda y id

-- Coyoneda -----------------------------------------
data CoYoneda f a = forall b . CoYoneda (b -> a) (f b)

instance Functor (CoYoneda f) where
  fmap f (CoYoneda mp fb) = CoYoneda (f . mp) fb
  
toCoYoneda :: f a -> CoYoneda f a
toCoYoneda fa = CoYoneda id fa

fromCoYoneda :: Functor f => CoYoneda f a -> f a
fromCoYoneda (CoYoneda mp fb) = fmap mp fb
```
