Hola,

This site is mostly about functional programming and software engineering. Occasionally thoughts on foreign language learning or any other thing I'll be into. I wanted to have my own homepage back in 1999, now I finally have one.

For anyone looking to hire, [here's my CV](https://vvviiimmm.github.io/cv/)
