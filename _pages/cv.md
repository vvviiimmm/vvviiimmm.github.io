## About

Eleven years of software engineering experience, a dozen programming languages, and quite a few technology stacks. Passionate about functional programming, Scala, Haskell, category theory, logic, and everything in between. Spend most of my free time learning Mandarin and Spanish, hacking on things, or just being outside more. I've been traveling full-time and working remotely since March 2018. Most likely, I'm somewhere in Southeast Asia right now.

## Work experience
### ![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/common/upstartlogo.png){: .align-right} Scala Developer at [UpStart Commerce, Inc.](https://www.upstartcommerce.com/).

_May 2020 - Present_

"Upstart commerce" is a startup company offering a headless e-commerce platform, a set of backend services providing APIs for various e-commerce needs. Big features, small bugs, production support, customer issues—you have to do it all in a small company. Besides that, we're slowly moving towards reimplementing most of the key services in a pure FP, ZIO-based architecture.

PL: Scala

### ![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/common/sisenselogo.jpg){: .align-right} Team/Tech Leader at [Sisense Inc](https://www.sisense.com).

_December 2016 - May 2020_

I was leading a "Data Connectors" team working on providing connectivity to different data sources, normalizing the schema and extracting data for analytical purposes; targeting a wide range of data sources, like relational databases (MSSQL, MySQL, Postgres, etc.), file-based (CSV, Excel files), analytical databases and warehouses (Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake), web services and social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Stripe, Hubspot, etc.) and many more. We used Scala for all of our projects with a high emphasis on functional programming. I've put a lot of effort into mentoring newcomers with OOP background to help them make the switch and educate other people about the benefits of FP.

PL: Mostly Scala, a bit of Java and C#, targeting Windows and Linux with Kubernetes orchestration.

### ![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/common/sisenselogo.jpg){: .align-right} Scala Developer at [Sisense Inc](https://www.sisense.com).

_December 2015 - December 2016_

Joined the company to design and implement an ETL infrastructure for connecting to various data sources and bring data into our proprietary data warehouse. The new framework design had to support multiple run time environments, be scalable, extendable and provide an SDK for 3rd party connectors development. It was implemented on JVM using Scala (the one I was leading) and on .NET using C#. The performance was vital, so it was quite an interesting and challenging experience designing a purely functional system that would perform as fast as an imperative version.

PL: Scala and C#

### ![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/common/teramindlogo.jpg){: .align-right} Senior C++ Developer at [Teramind Inc](https://www.teramind.co).

_August 2015 - November 2015_

Teramind is a startup company specializing in website and application monitoring, file tracking, network capture, session recording, and activity analysis. I was leading the OS X development branch of the project, ensuring that all features are aligned across platforms with the same quality level. Designed and implemented kernel extensions for darwin kernel that had to:

- Control filesystem authentication: monitor or block folder activity, external drives mounting, network shares connections, cloud drives uploads/downloads

- Filter network TCP/UDP packets. Receive, decode and parse application layer protocols like HTTP, SMTP, pop3, TLS/SSL, etc. and eventually make a decision based on the packet's content.

PL: C++ for application code and C for kernel extensions, targeting OS X

### ![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/common/playtechlogo.jpg){: .align-right} C++ Developer at [Playtech](https://www.playtech.com), Poker

_July 2014 - August 2015_

Playtech's Poker department develops an online poker platform. I was responsible for unifying multiple (platform-dependent) codebases under one solution that would simplify the app's development, deployment, and maintenance. That involved porting existing functionality from iOS to Windows and Mac and vise versa. There were a lot of technical challenges that required deep knowledge of various low-level components and compilers.

PL: Mostly C++
